function vessels = spline_centreline(vessels, piece_spacing, remove_invalid)
% Apply a least squares, smoothing spline fit to a number of Nx2
% dimensional arrays, treating them as coordinates, and output the fitted
% (i.e. smoothed) coordinates.  The arrays should already be sorted
% appropriately, so that coordinates are consecutive.
%
% This is useful for creating a smoother representation of lines defined
% originally in terms of discrete pixel coordinates, and also computing the
% angle of the line perpendicular to the fit at each (output) coordinate,
% since the derivative of the spline can be calculated.
%
% Note that this assumes a 2D fitting problem of coordinates.  An
% additional paramter is introduced based upon the Euclidean distance
% between coordinates, and this is used when applying 1D fits to each
% coordinate.  More information is given in the code comments.
%
% INPUT:
%   VESSELS - an array of VESSEL objects, in which the CENTRE property is
%   set.
%   PIECE_SPACING - the approximate spacing that should occur between
%   spline pieces.  The total length of the coordinate array (computed by
%   summing the Euclidean distances between each pair or coordinates) is
%   divided by this in order to figure out how many pieces should make up
%   the spline.  Note: if only one piece is needed, a least squares
%   polynomial fit is applied.  A higher value implies fewer pieces, and
%   therefore a smoother spline fit.
%   REMOVE_INVALID - TRUE if invalid vessels (i.e. those with too few
%   centre points for angle computations to work, which in this case means
%   just one point) should be removed from VESSELS, FALSE otherwise
%   (Default = TRUE).
%
% OUTPUT:
%   The same as the input VESSELS array.  It will now contain refined
%   CENTRE coordinates (dependent upon the spline fit) and the ANGLES
%   property, which gives unit vectors perpendicular to the
%   spline fit at the corresponding coordinate stored in the output CENTRE
%   (i.e. it gives the angle of the line through which the image profiles
%   should be computed).  However, note that some vessels might have been
%   removed if REMOVE_INVALID is TRUE.

% May need to delete some vessels
remove_inds = false(size(vessels));

    % NOTE: In the following, Y is Nx2 and X is Nx1 - that is, the original
    % coordinates are stored within Y, and X is a newly-introduced
    % parameter based upon the distance between them.  Spline fits are
    % applied to each column of Y (i.e. each coordinate) independently of
    % one another, but reliant upon X.  In other words, it is like
    % calculating a 1D spline fit between X and Y(:,1), and another between
    % X and Y(:,2), then evaluating both of these again to get the smoothed
    % coordinates.

        % Using the spline toolbox, it's possible to change the spline
        % order and provide a bit more control of the output.  But the
        % dependency on having the additional toolbox is undesireable and,
        % at least as of R2009b, the spline toolbox is considerably slower
        % (due in part to frequent use of string comparisons for input
        % checking, and REPMAT rather than BSXFUN).
        % So use instead the built-in SPLINE functions of MATLAB.

        % possibly to set SPPARMS before and after the loop.  Nevertheless,
        % here we accept the increase in computation time (which may only
        % be a few tens or hundredths of a second) and just use SPLINE as
