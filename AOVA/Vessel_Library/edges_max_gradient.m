  % Identify vessel edges from image profiles based upon local steepness.
  %
  % First, compute the profiles perpendicular to each vessel according to
  % the centre points and angles already stored in VESSEL_DATA.VESSEL_LIST.
  % Then set the vessel edges based upon zero crossings of the 2nd derivative
  % perpendicular to the vessel.  Gaussian filtering is used for smoothing,
  % where the filter size relates to a provisional vessel diameter estimate.
  % The smoothing is applied to the image profiles (rather than the original
  % image directly), and separably along the columns (parallel to the vessel)
  % and rows (perpendicular to the vessel) of the images profiles.
  %
  % The sigma value for the Gaussian filtering is determined individually for
  % each vessel based upon an estimate of the vessel width made first from
  % the segmented image VESSEL_DATA.BW, and then refined from the mean of all
  % the profiles computed for that vessel.
  % Compute the coordinates of vessel edges from image profiles.
  % The edges of each vessel are provisionally identified from averaged
  % profiles computed along the length of the vessel, based upon the maximum
  % gradient magnitude to either size of the centreline and within the
  % vincinity of the relevant vessel edges depicted in the binary image in
  % which the vessels were first detected.
  %
  % Based upon the distance between these estimated edges, an anisotropic
  % Gaussian filter is applied.  By working with stacked profiles
  % perpendicular to the vessel, the filter can effectively be oriented
  % parallel to it.
  % An approximate of the 2nd derivative is then computed perpendicular to
  % the vessel and its zero-crossings are used to more precisely locate each
  % edges, this time guided by the mean edge locations previously identified
  % from the maximum gradient.
